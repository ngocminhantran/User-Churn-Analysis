# Telecom User Churn Analysis
## Project Description
### Introduction
The Dataset includes one table with information about customers of a Telecom company (information about demographics, churn, service, contract).
### Problem Statement
Managers want to understand the churn rate, churner profile and reasons behind churn to lower user churn. Therefore, the goal for Data Analyst is to create a dashboard on the churn situation of the company and propose solutions to improve status quo.
### Tasks
1. Create a Design Thinking spreadsheet to accurately understand the problem and devise steps for dashboard building, insight and recommendation making.
2. Create a PowerBI Dashboard.
3. Give insights and recommendations.

## Insights and recommendation
### Insights
#### Overview
The current churn rate (~27%) is higher than the average churn rate (21%) in Telecom industry (according to Statista, 2020, assuming the company is based in the US). This group contributed up to about $1,368,000 (about 16%) to the companyâ€™s revenue. The company, therefore, needs to take action on this problem as soon as possible.
#### Churner profile
- In terms of gender, males and females account for almost the same proportion in both customer and churner profile.
- In terms of age, customers and churners are both mostly above 30 years old (accounting for above 80%).
- In terms of tenure, the group 0-20 accounts for 66.6% of all churners, which mean that churn is recorded mostly among newly acquired customers. 
- In terms of geography, CA is the state with the highest churn rate (an alarming 63%). OH, PA, MD, NE follow, with churn rate recorded all above 30%.
- In terms of service, only 5.5% of churners subscribe in group while this figure for customers is 22.7%. We can see that those who subscribe in groups are much less likely to churn compared to their non-group counterparts. While 60.66% of customers make/receive no customer service calls (CSV) and only 4.32% make/receive 5 CSV, the figures for churners are 20.1% and 16.1% respectively. This is understandable as churners are those call agents need to deal with frequently.
- In terms of contract, 88% of churners use month-to-month contracts (much higher than 51% among customers). This is probably because month-to-month contracts have fewer obligation and are easier to stop subscription. 71.1% of churners pay by direct debit (while this figure for customers is 55.6%).
- On average, total charges of churners is lower than that of customers ($761 vs. $1,080) yet monthly charges of churners is higher ($36.8 vs $31).
#### Churn reason
Most important trigger for churn users is Competitor (~45%) whether filtering by Agegroup or Station(Location). It causes a 45% loss in revenue as well which is also the biggest proportion in Total revenue loss by churn users.
## Recommendations
There are 4 churn categories:
(1) Competitor (biggest category)
- Conduct competitor analysis to compare the company with its competitors, and thus find solutions to stand out.
(2) Product
- Conduct surveys to find out what causes the dissatisfaction with the product.
- Work with the R & D department to find out the way to improve the current product.
(3) Customer services
- Check out how the customer services team is doing. Can the team performance be improved via new rules or incentives?
(4) Price
- Conduct competitor analysis.
- Re-evaluate pricing model: consider offering different price options for different customer tenure groups.
- Deeper analysis for the 0-20 tenure group, business situation in CA state and the impact of paying method on user churn.
