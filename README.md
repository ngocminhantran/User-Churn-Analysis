# Telecom User Churn Analysis
## Project Description
### Introduction
The Dataset includes one table with information about customers of a Telecom company (information about demographics, churn, service, contract).
### Problem Statement
Managers want to understand the churn rate, churner profile and reasons behind churn to lower user churn. 

Therefore, the goal for Data Analyst is to create a dashboard on the churn situation of the company and propose solutions to improve status quo.
### Tasks
1. Create a Design Thinking spreadsheet to accurately understand the problem and devise steps for dashboard building, insight and recommendation making.
2. Create a PowerBI Dashboard.
3. Give insights and recommendations.

## Insights and recommendation
### Insights
#### General business situation
- Total sales and Gross profit rose steadily over the years, and also doubled after 3 years (2011 - 2014). The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is 17.46%. Within a year, revenue and profit in all categories increased over the quarters, peaked in Q4 and dropped sharply in Q1 the following year.
- Gross Profit Margin remained stable throughout the period, averaging 11.61%.
- Revenue YoY Growth Rate increased consistently, from 18.5% in 2012 to 26.25% in 2014.
- Return Rate hovered above 4.5% over the 4 years, with 2016 recording the lowest 4.55% - a small decrease compared to the prior years.
- The Value of Orders has not changed much over the years (above $500). The Average Shipping Days also recorded almost no change (around 4 days).
- The Value of Returned Orders peaked in 2014. The Average Value Per Order of returned orders was 70% higher than that of successful ones. Returned orders were recorded in 4 markets: APAC (32%), US(22%), EU(25%), LATAM(20%), which were also top 4 largest markets in terms of overall sales and profit.
- B2C customer group is the main revenue generating group for the company (51%), followed by Corporate (30%) and Home Office. However, in recent years, revenue from the top group has been on a slight downward trend. Meanwhile, revenue from the Home Office customer segment tended to increase.
- In terms of shipping mode, Standard Class was the most popular, accounting for 60%, followed by Second class (20%) and First class (14%). Same Day Delivery was the least chosen.
- In terms of salesperson, the top 6 highest performing salespersons (accounting for over 70% total sales) were working in the 4 biggest markets (APAC, EU, US, LATAM).
#### Markets
- The top 3 revenue-generating markets were APAC ($3.59M, accounting for 28.36%), EU ($2.94M, accounting for 23.24%) and US ($2.3M, accounting for 18.17%). In all 3 markets, Technology was the highest revenue-generating category (around 35%), followed by Furniture (around 35%) and Office Supplies.
- In the APAC, Chairs (14.31%), Bookcases (14.08%), Copiers (13.79%) and Phones (13.56%) were the main revenue-generating products. As Phones and Copiers had a higher profit margin than Bookcases and Chairs, the profit generated by the 2 former was higher. Tables were the only product to have a negative profit margin, and thus generated a loss (-$20,128).
- In the EU, Copiers (12.43%), Bookcases (12.37%), Phones (12.3%) and Storage (11.56%) were the main revenue drivers. Phones and Storage had lower profit margin, therefore created lower profit than several other products. Tables also had negative gross profit in this market (~ -$21,000).
- In the US market, phones (14.37%) and chairs (14.3%) were the only 2 products making up above 10% total sales. Though accounting for just 6.5% total revenue, copiers contributed the highest profit ($55,617). Tables and bookcases recorded -$17,725 and -$3,472 gross profit.
- In terms of compound annual growth rate (CAGR), the Canadian market had the strongest growth (28.45%) followed by Africa (22.14%) although these were the two markets with the lowest revenue. Despite being one of the three major markets, the US had the lowest growth rate (approximately 10%).
- By country, the US is the country bringing in the largest revenue (2.2M), 2.4 times higher than the second country. Within the top 5 highest-revenue countries, China had the highest gross profit margin (21.51%).
#### Products
- The company's products were seasonal, with revenue increasing sharply at the end of the year.
- Technology and Office Supplies recorded the highest gross profit margin (13.99% and 13.69%), doubling that of Furniture (6.94%).
- Sub-categories bringing the largest revenue include Phones ($1.7M), Copiers ($1.5M), Chairs ($1.5M), Bookcase ($1.4M).
- Sub-categories with the highest profit margin include Paper (24.24%), Labels (20.45%), Envelopes (17.32%), Accessories (17.29%), Copier (17.13%). Among those sub-categories, only Copiers and Accessories had high revenue. The remaining were among the lowest revenue-generating sub-categories.
- Tables recorded negative profit margin (8.46%) although the revenue was acceptable (749K).
- By product, Apple Smartphone (full size) was the biggest revenue driver ($86,925). However, the productâ€™s profit margin is low (6.81%) and thus its profit was lower than several other products. Within the top 5 highest revenue products, Canon ImageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier had the highest profit margin (up to nearly 41%), and thus its profit ranked 1st (~$25,200) though its revenue ranked 5th. Throughout the 4 years, top 5 was made up mostly by smartphones (Apple, Cisco, Nokia, Motorola).
### Recommendations
1. With regards to markets
- Focus on developing and expanding the US market, where total sales was the largest, profit margin was above average yet growth rate was slow. In the US, it is necessary to focus on sub-categories: Phones, Accessories, Copies (Tech); Chairs (Furniture); Binders (Office Supplies). 
- Continue business promotion strategy in 2 other major markets, namely APAC and EU.
- Develop business strategy to exploit the potential of Canada and Africa (large profit margin, high CAGR). In these 2 markets, focus on Technology and Office Supplies.
- Reconsider business plan in EMEA as total sales and profit margin were both low
2. With regards to products
- Focus on the key product category: Technology, especially the subcategories Phones and Copies. These were the 2 subcategories with the largest total sales, higher profit margin than average and top 5 best-selling products also belonged to these 2 subcategories. Continue to increase profit margin in these 2 subcategories, along with some other best-selling subcategories like Chairs, Bookcases (Furniture); Storage, Appliances (Office Supplies).
- Increase sales of Paper and Labels (Office Supplies) because these were the 2 subcategories with the largest profit margin.
- Reconsider continuing the business of subcategory Table.
3. Research the reasons behind the sales pattern (sales increased towards year end, dropped at year beginning) to implement the suitable business development plan. Promote marketing activities in the 3rd and 4th quarters of each year.
4. Research the reasons behind unchanged return rate and high return order value. Find approaches to minimize return order.
5. Promote and cross-sale activities to increase order value.
6. Improve the application of technology and the efficiency of supply chain management to optimize shipping time.
